## Problem Statement
- To write a program in python using a pygame module that will
animate a 2D Snake Game using many multimedia functionalities
like images, audio and video.

## Problem Solution
- By creating a 2D snake game using pygame module, it is
beginner-friendly, making it a great platform for all adults and kids
to like and the code written in pygame is kept simple which can
run across many platforms and operating systems.

## Abstract
Slytherin is a 2D snake game made using the pygame module. Some of its main features are :

<pre>
➢ Main menu
➢ Pause functionality
➢ Highest score counter
➢ Runtime score
➢ Game music
</pre>

The problem is to design a Snake Game which provides the following functionalities:

- Snake can move in a given direction and when it eats the food,
the length of snake increases.

- When the snake crosses itself, the game will be over.
